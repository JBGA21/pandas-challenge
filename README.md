By performing different analysis in our dataset: ‘purchase_data.csv’ we can observe several trends which are determined by different features such as: Gender, Age and Items Price.

Trend 1 – Gender
The first trend we identify is that although the vast majority of our dataset records/purchases/sales come from Male gender 652 (83.5%), the Female gender, with 113 (14.5%) purchases, spent more by paying a higher average purchase price of $3.20 vs $3.02 of Male and obtaining a higher Avg Total Purchase per Person of $4.47 vs $4.07 of Male. 

This could be a powerful insight for creating future marketing campaigns that target new or existing female players to join the game in order to increase the number of purchases female player made (81).

Trend 2 – Age
The second trend we found was by grouping the purchases records according to where the users age falls between the ranges of age we defined. We can see that the users who fall between 15 to 29 years old are those who make a higher number of purchases and therefore they account for a higher total purchase value.

However, once we look closer to see how much a unique user spends per purchase, we can see that age ranges of 35-39 with $4.76, <10 with $4.54 and 20-24 with $4.32 have a very high potential since users from these age ranges are on average spending more than other users from other ages. So again, this information can lead us to target these age segments in order to increase their purchases count and create more value for the company

Trend 3 – Items Price
The third and final trend we can observe from the analysis is related to the items price. Something that it’s very interesting is that the 5 most popular items by purchase count have a range price between $3.53 to $4.61 while the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value range price between $4.35 to $4.61, all this data allow us to have a wider perspective of what to do if we want to improve volume or value since we can observe that if our objective is to increase purchase count of items, we need to offer items that at least start from $3.53. 

Something else we can notice about our data is that price has a left-skewed distribution because the average price of our dataset is $3.05 while the median is $3.15. This show us that most our purchases are on the right side of our curve and have a price that is greater than $3.15. Finally, we can cross these data with the top 5 spenders’ data which tell us that they purchase around 3 to 5 items, with an average purchase price that ranges from $3.40 to $4.61 and their total purchase value is around $13.10 to $18.96. 

All these insights can help us to identify a trend in items prices such as a successful average item price is normally around $3.40 to $4.61 and adapting more items prices within this range could lead the company to have an increment in volume and probably in value.
